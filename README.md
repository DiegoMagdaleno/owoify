# owoify
This is an Xposed module that turns your system furry. It makes almost every TextView use OwOified speak.

You don't want to use this on your daily driver. Seriously.

## Inspiration
There's been a [jailbreak tweak](https://github.com/lint/nepeta-repos/tree/master/OwO) for over a year which does something similar to this, popularised by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/_Ninji/status/1105800686963490821) by Ninji.
Since then, an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zuzak/owo) sprung up, which was then used to create [BBC Bweaking](https://twitter.com/BBCBweaking), and more recently my very own [Schlatt in OwO](https://twitter.com/jschwatt_owo)

That's how this hellish beast came about. You're welcome.

## Download
Downloads can be found on the releases page.

## Sources
The list of prefixes, suffixes and replacements came from [zuzak's owo npm package](https://github.com/zuzak/owo), under the MIT licence; which itself sourced the list from the [jailbreak tweak](https://github.com/lint/nepeta-repos/tree/master/OwO)

Some of the Xposed implementation code came from the classic [Hodor module](https://github.com/GermainZ/Hodor) by GermainZ
